Segmenation Issue ('uint8' -> 'uint32')
- During working on 3_Real-Time_System, I found it issue at the segmentation phase in the preprocessing
- Starting points for that were converted automatically under 255 due to the number function of numpy ('uint8')
- which means that all segments were extracted at the front part starting under 255 and they were overlapped extremely
- Hence, the results so far were invalidated and it is needed to conduct the experiments and analyze its results all over again 
- The invalidated experiments are corresponding to the folders 01_10p_overlap ~ 04_shorten_length

Training & Fine-tuning (subsample monitoring -> whole sample monitoring, model selection based on val_loss -> manually)
- The monitoring values from subsample of the training set and the validation set in the training phase
- could not represent the model's performance for whole tranining data
- Changed the way monitoring of the results from subsample to whole sample
- The performance for the testing data depended on both train_loss and val_loss
- Decided not to use automatic model selection based only val_loss
